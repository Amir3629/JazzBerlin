# STRICT CHANGE CONTROL RULES

1. ONLY make changes that are EXPLICITLY requested by the user
2. NO SIDE EFFECTS: Do not modify any other functionality or styling that wasn't specifically mentioned
3. Before making any changes:
   - Document what specific changes will be made
   - List any potential impacts
   - Get confirmation if any additional files need to be modified
4. After making changes:
   - Verify that ONLY the requested changes were implemented
   - Confirm no other functionality was affected
5. NEVER modify:
   - Social media icons
   - Sorting functionality
   - Any existing working features
6. If a requested change might affect other components:
   - Stop and ask for clarification
   - Explain potential impacts
   - Get explicit approval before proceeding

NOT allowed: Change any other styling, functionality, or components
